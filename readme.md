This is a simple test given out by Astract9. It's an app that allows Users to register using their basic details.
Once registered, a notification message will pop up telling them to wait till the Admin activates their account before they will be able to log in.
Once the admin activates their accounts, they will be able to log in and send a message to the Admin.
Admin can login to view all users and their messages.
This is unlike the default configuration of Laravel that logs in new user immediately once he/she registers.
It was developed using Laravel5.
